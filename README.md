**Facebook Redesign Using Figma**

As part of my ongoing journey in UI/UX design, I undertook the challenge of redesigning Facebook using Figma. My goal was to modernize the user interface and enhance the overall user experience while maintaining the core functionalities that make Facebook a go-to social platform.

**Wireframing**

I started with low-fidelity wireframes to map out the basic layout and structure of the redesigned interface. This helped in visualizing the overall flow and placement of key elements such as the notifications, messages, and profile sections.
